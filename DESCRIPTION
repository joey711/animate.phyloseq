Title: Animation tools to complement the phyloseq package
Type: Package
Author: Paul J. McMurdie <mcmurdie@stanford.edu>
Description: The phyloseq package is a recent addition to the Bioconductor
    repository. One of the goals of the phyloseq project is syntactically
    streamlined tools for creating publication-quality graphics based on
    phylogenetic sequencing data using ggplot2. This package is intended to
    complement phyloseq by providing tools for animating phyloseq graphics.
    However, some of the tools can work generally on any data.frame, and so may
    be of use beyond phylogenetic sequencing analysis. The animations are
    created entirely via ggplot2 and animation packages. The animation package
    further depends on external conversion tools, e.g. ImageMagick or FFmpeg.
